## Problems

### [Problem 1: Three Ways to Sum to N](./src/problem1/README.md)

TypeScript implementation of three different approaches to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to n:

- Iterative approach (O(n) time, O(1) space)
- Mathematical formula (O(1) time, O(1) space)
- Recursive approach (O(n) time, O(n) space)

### [Problem 2: Token Swap Application](./src/problem2/README.md)

A modern React/TypeScript token swap interface featuring:

- Real-time cryptocurrency price data from Switcheo API
- Intuitive swap interface with form validation
- Smart token selection and slippage controls
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui

### [Problem 3: WalletPage Refactoring](./src/problem3/README.md)

Code review and refactoring of a React wallet component, addressing:

- Critical bugs (undefined variables, wrong filter logic)
- Performance optimizations (memoization, efficient mapping)
- Type safety improvements (proper TypeScript types)
